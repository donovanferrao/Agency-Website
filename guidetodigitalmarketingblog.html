              <u>Here are some of the benefits of digital marketing over traditional marketing:<br /></u>
              1) Digital marketing is more cost-effective and efficient than traditional marketing.

Digital marketing also allows businesses to track and measure their performance and ROI easily, using tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Insights, and others.<br /> <br /> 
              2) Digital marketing is more interactive and engaging than traditional marketing. Digital marketing enables businesses to communicate with their customers and prospects in a two-way and personalized manner, using digital channels and technologies like social media, email, chatbots, and others.
